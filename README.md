### Images 

We designed a lot of images that you can use. Check the [Images](https://github.com/quantixx/template-presentation/tree/master/images/2025) folder.

### What is the recommended format for the templates? 

Almost all presentations are recorded during Devoxx France. Your presentation will be available few weeks after Devoxx France on the [Youtube Devoxx channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsVPQfo5RZErDL41LoWvk0A) 

We recommend that you keep the **16/9** ratio format for optimal display.
Devoxx France are not mandatory. If you prefer to use your own presentation, do it.
However please insert a first slide with the Devoxx France theme, then keep your presentation as it is. Always remember : your presentation is recorded. 

Last but not least, we also have a code of conduct on the Devoxx France web site. Make sure to check that your content 
is compliant with our [Code of Conduct](https://www.devoxx.fr/code-de-conduite/).
